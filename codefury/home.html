        <h1 class="staup">start up</h1>
         <p class="young">  Startups are young companies founded to develop a unique product or service, bring it to market and make it irresistible and irreplaceable for customers.</p>
        <p  class="term">The term startup refers to a company in the first stages of operations. Startups are founded by one or more entrepreneurs who want to develop a product or service for which they believe there is demand.</p>
        <h3 class="why">Why should we work for a start up?</h3>
        <p class="hallmark">A hallmark of startups is their energy and excitement. The newness and potential for success can create a positive, motivating environment that employees enjoy being a part of each day. When everyone shared a common goal of building the business, it enhances employee commitment and productivity.</p>
        <p class="hallmark" >In startups, learning takes place by simply rolling up your sleeves and doing, with fast feedback on how well you are doing. Startups tend to encourage a culture of learning by experimentation, and small projects have the potential to become future game-changing projects.</p>
        <p  class="hallmark">Working at a startup can present big opportunities to step up and lead. As a startup grows, your scope of responsibility and experience grows simultaneously. For a young and experience hungry employee, startups provide the best possible opportunity to accelerate your career. Startup years are like dog years – One year at a startup is like seven anywhere else. Instead of working at a low intensity for 40 years, you work as hard as you possibly can in four!</p>

    <div class="fail">
        <h3 class="fails">Why do startup fails?</h3>
        <p class="according">According to business owners, reasons for failure include money running out, being in the wrong market, a lack of research, bad partnerships, ineffective marketing, and not being an expert in the industry.</p>
        <p class="according">A fourth major reason that startups fail is because they ran out of cash. A key job of the CEO is to understand how much cash is left and whether that will carry the company to a milestone that can lead to a successful financing, or to cash flow positive.</p>
        <p class="according">The valuations of a startup don’t change in a linear fashion over time. Simply because it was twelve months since you raised your Series A round, does not mean that you are now worth more money. To reach an increase in valuation, a company must achieve certain key milestones. For a software company, these might look something like the following (these are not hard and fast rules):</p>
        <p  class="according">What frequently goes wrong, and leads to a company running out of cash, and unable to raise more, is that management failed to achieve the next milestone before cash ran out. Many times it is still possible to raise cash, but the valuation will be significantly lower.</p>
